In this research, I cluster Two data-sets using five different clustering algorithms
, I show and analyze the results in purpose to find the best clustering algorithm
for each data set. Additionally, I use an algorithm of anomaly detection
and show the impact of the anomaly points on the clustering quality . Finally, I
figure out that, in HTRU2 data-set, Spectral is the best clustering algorithm both
in internal and external terms, in AllUserData data-set, GMM has the best external
fitment while Spectral provides the best internal quality. Moreover, I noticed that
in most algorithms, clustering without anomaly points is better both in HTRU2
and AllUserData .
